# Introduction
- What is BSD? (Generalizations...)
	- FreeBSD
		- Most popular for general use
	- OpenBSD
		- Strong focus on security
		- Child projects
			- OpenSSH
			- PF
			- CARP
			- LibreSSL
	- NetBSD
		- Runs on everythiing
- Why use FreeBSD over Linux?
	- It irritates Arsh
	- Logo is a cool demon, not a dumb-looking penguin
	- Handbook
	- Singular project
	- Smaller community
		- More welcoming
		- Easier to get help
		- Easier to get involved
	- Less restrictive license
		- ZFS
		- dtrace
	- Jails
	- Software distribution
		- pkgng for most stuff
		- Ports tree if you need to customize the build
	- IPFW and PF are a million times easier to use than iptables
- Why not?
	- Smaller community
	- Fewer resources available online for help
	- Less likely to run into it in your career or CCDC
	- Software compatibility
		- There is a Linux emulation layer for closed-source software, but it's hit-or-miss
	- Harder to get started
		- PC-BSD makes it easier
- What's the same?
	- Most basic commands, with occasionally different flags
	- General directory structure
- What's different?
	- User-installed software ends up in `/usr/local` instead of `/`
	- File systems
		- UFS
			- Generic use
		- ZFS
			- More resource-heavy
			- Really, really awesome
	- By default, no `sudo` or `nano`
	- Firewalls
	- Ports tree

# Let's Do Something
- Log in as root
- Install sl through ports
	- `portsnap fetch`
	- `portsnap extract`
	- cd `/usr/ports/games/sl`
	- `make`
	- `make install`
- Ports are kind of a pain, let's use `pkg`
	- `pkg install sudo nano`
	- How would we go about setting up an Apache webserver like we did last week?
		- `pkg search apache | less`
		- `pkg install apache24`
		- `service apache24 start`
			- It's not enabled? Hmm...
		- `nano /etc/rc.conf`
			- OR: `sysrc apache24_enable=YES`
		- `service apache24 start`
		- `sockstat -46`
