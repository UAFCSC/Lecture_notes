# Lecture_notes
This is the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cyber Security Club's collection of training material. This is an attempt to publish our notes, slides and other materials we make for training our members. This repo was started in Fall 2017 and some of our older stuff can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8wWpU2kxwL2S3RUempTMWVkU2M&usp=sharing) (Requires UA Email). 

## Labs
Some topics may have associated labs. The solutions and VMs for these labs are not public, though we may decide to release them in the future. Contact a club officer via email at csc.uaf[@]alaska.edu to get access to labs (UAF students only).
